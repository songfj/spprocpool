spprocpool is a Unix/Linux preforked server library. Several TCP preforked server frameworks are included. The first uses descriptor passing, the second uses a Leader/Follower process pool, and the third uses a combination of a multiprocessing and a multi-threading model. A general-purpose, non-server process pool is included, and it can been used in a multi-threaded environment.
